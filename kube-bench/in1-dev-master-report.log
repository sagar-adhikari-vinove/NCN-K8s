1.1.9 Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the control plane node.
For example, chmod 644 <path/to/cni/files>

1.1.10 Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the control plane node.
For example,
chown root:root <path/to/cni/files>

1.1.12 On the etcd server node, get the etcd data directory, passed as an argument --data-dir,
from the command 'ps -ef | grep etcd'.
Run the below command (based on the etcd data directory found above).
For example, chown etcd:etcd /var/lib/etcd
